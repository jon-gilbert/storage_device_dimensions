# Storage Device Dimensions
A collection of SFF and SNIA specified-dimensions translated to OpenSCAD.

A selection of models from the following SFF form-factors are available as OpenSCAD libraries that produce simplified, but dimensionally-accurate STL models:
* [SFF-82XX](https://github.com/jon-gilbert/storage_device_dimensions/wiki/sff-82XX.md): 2.5" internal disk drives
* [SFF-83XX](https://github.com/jon-gilbert/storage_device_dimensions/wiki/sff-82XX.md): 3.5" internal disk drives
* [SFF-85XX](https://github.com/jon-gilbert/storage_device_dimensions/wiki/sff-82XX.md): 5.25" external disk drives

SFF specifications come from [SNIA](https://www.snia.org/)'s [SFF Technology Affiliate Technical Working Group](https://www.snia.org/sff). These libraries and models are not associate or affilated with SFF or its partners in any way.
